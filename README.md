# snyk/broker

Snyk broker proxies access between snyk.io and source-code management systems (SCMs) such as GitHub Enterprise, GitHub.com and Bitbucket Server.

The broker server and client establish an applicative tunnel, proxying requests from snyk.io to the SCM (fetching manifest files from monitored repositories), and vice versa (webhooks posted by the SCM).

The broker client runs within the user's internal network, keeping sensitive data such as SCM tokens within the network perimeter. The applicative tunnel scans and whitelists only relevant requests, narrowing down the access permissions to the bare minimum required for Snyk to actively monitor a repository.

## Usage

The broker client is published as a set of docker images, each configured for a specific SCM. Custom configuration is provided as environment variables.

### GitHub.com

To use the the broker client with GitHub.com, run `docker pull snyk/broker:github-com`. The following environment variables are needed to customize the broker client:

- `BROKER_TOKEN` - the snyk broker token, obtained from your snyk org settings view.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - a personal access token with full `repo` and `admin:repo_hook` scopes.
- `PORT` - the local port at which the broker client accepts connections. Default is 7341.
- `BROKER_CLIENT_URL` - the full URL of the broker client as it will be accessible by GitHub.com webhooks, such as `http://my.broker.client:7341`

#### Command-line arguments

You can run the docker container by providing the relevant configuration:

```
docker run --restart=always \
           -p 8000:8000 \
           -e BROKER_TOKEN=secret-broker-token \
           -e GITHUB_TOKEN=secret-github-token \
           -e PORT=8000 \
           -e BROKER_CLIENT_URL=http://my.broker.client:8000 \
       snyk/broker:github-com
```

#### Derived docker image

Another option is to build your own docker image and override relevant environment variables:

```
FROM snyk/broker:github-com

ENV BROKER_TOKEN      secret-broker-token
ENV GITHUB_TOKEN      secret-github-token
ENV PORT              8000
ENV BROKER_CLIENT_URL http://my.broker.client:8000
```

ENV BROKER_CLIENT_URL   http://my.broker.client:8000
ENV PORT                8000
```

### Advanced Configuration

#### HTTPS

The broker client runs an HTTP server by default. It can be configured to run an HTTPS server for local connections. This requires an SSL certificate and a private key to be provided to the docker container at runtime.

For example, if your certificate files are found locally at `./private/broker.crt` and `./private/broker.key`, provide these files to the docker container by mounting the folder and using the `HTTPS_CERT` and `HTTPS_KEY` environment variables:

```
docker run --restart=always \
           -p 8000:8000 \
           -e BROKER_TOKEN=secret-broker-token \
           -e GITHUB_TOKEN=secret-github-token \
           -e PORT=8000 \
           -e HTTPS_CERT=/private/broker.crt \
           -e HTTPS_KEY=/private/broker.key \
           -e BROKER_CLIENT_URL=https://my.broker.client:8000 \
           -v /local/path/to/private:/private \
       snyk/broker:github-com
```

Note that `BROKER_CLIENT_URL` now has the HTTPS scheme.

#### SCM with an internal certificate

By default, the broker client establishes HTTPS connections to the SCM. If your SCM is serving an internal certificate (signed by your own CA), you can provide the CA certificate to the broker client.

For example, if your CA certificate is at `./private/ca.cert.pem`, provide it to the docker container by mounting the folder and using the `CA_CERT` environment variable:

```
docker run --restart=always \
           -p 8000:8000 \
           -e BROKER_TOKEN=secret-broker-token \
           -e BITBUCKET_USERNAME=username \
           -e BITBUCKET_PASSWORD=password \
           -e BITBUCKET=your.bitbucket-server.domain.com \
           -e BITBUCKET_API=your.bitbucket-server.domain.com/rest/api/1.0 \
           -e PORT=8000 \
           -e CA_CERT=/private/ca.cert.pem \
           -v /local/path/to/private:/private \
       snyk/broker:bitbucket-server
```

### Custom white-listing filter

The default white-listing filter supports the bare minimum to operate on all repositories supported by Snyk. In order to customize the white-listing filter, create the default one locally by installing `snyk-broker` and running `broker init [SCM type]`. The created `accept.json` is the default filter for the chosen SCM. Place the file in a separate folder such as `./private/accept.json`, and provide it to the docker container by mounting the folder and using the `ACCEPT` environment variable:

```
docker run --restart=always \
           -p 8000:8000 \
           -e BROKER_TOKEN=secret-broker-token \
           -e GITHUB_TOKEN=secret-github-token \
           -e PORT=8000 \
           -e BROKER_CLIENT_URL=https://my.broker.client:8000 \
           -e ACCEPT=/private/accept.json
           -v /local/path/to/private:/private \
       snyk/broker:github-com
```

### Mounting Secrets
Sometime it is required to load sensitive configurations (GitHub/Snyk's token) from a file instead from environment variables. Broker is using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to load the config, so the process is relatively simple:
* Create a file named `.env` and put your sensitive config there:
```
BROKER_TOKEN=secret-broker-token
```
* Mount this file (for example, using [Kuberentes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/distribute-credentials-secure/#create-a-pod-that-has-access-to-the-secret-data-through-a-volume)). Mount the file to be somewhere like `/broker`.
* Change the workdir of the docker image to be `/broker`/
